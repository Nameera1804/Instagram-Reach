## Introduction

This project is designed to analyze Instagram reach and engagement metrics to gain insights into factors affecting post performance. By analyzing and predicting metrics like impressions, likes, comments, and engagement rates, we aim to help social media managers and content creators understand what contributes to higher engagement on Instagram.

## Features

- **Data Collection:** Collecting and cleaning Instagram data related to reach and engagement.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing and understanding patterns and relationships in data.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Building regression models to predict impressions based on metrics like likes, comments, shares, and saves.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating insightful visualizations for better data interpretation.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Identifying key factors that influence Instagram impressions.

## Data Collection

Data Collection

The data for this analysis is gathered from Instagram's reach metrics. It includes metrics on post engagement, follower count, and other related data.

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset was cleaned and prepared for analysis. Steps included:
- Handling missing values
- Converting categorical variables
- Scaling and normalizing features as needed

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA phase involved visualizing various metrics to identify patterns and relationships:
- Distribution plots for likes, comments, and impressions
- Heatmap for correlations among metrics
- Scatter plots to explore relationships between impressions and other metrics

## Modeling and Prediction

A predictive model was built to estimate the number of impressions based on other metrics using machine learning algorithms. The models used include:

- **Passive-Aggressive Regressor** (or any other relevant models based on the experiments)

The model’s performance was evaluated based on metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.

## Results and Insights

The analysis provided insights into:
- The most influential metrics for driving impressions.
- The final section of the notebook discusses findings and insights from the EDA and model predictions, helping users understand key factors influencing Instagram reach.
- Suggestions on how to improve Instagram reach based on data findings.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/instagram-reach-analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd instagram-reach-analysis
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:** Replace the sample data in the `data/` folder with your own Instagram metrics if you want to analyze personal or brand-specific data.
2. **Run the Analysis Notebook:** Open the Jupyter notebook `Instagram_Reach_Analysis.ipynb` and follow the steps to perform data analysis and modeling.
3. **Model Prediction:** Once the model is trained, use it to predict impressions or other metrics for new data points by updating the sample data or adjusting parameters.
